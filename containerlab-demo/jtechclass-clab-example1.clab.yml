# Name is a required directive that allows containerlab to separate multiple labs running at once from each other
name: jtechclass-containerlab-example1

# The topology key here is the main aspect of the whole thing, it tells containerlab what devices to create and how to link them together
topology:
  # The nodes directive is that we can use to tell container lab what our nodes will be named and what images and type of nodes they are
  nodes:
    # This is our first node, which will use the name ceos1 and its of a type cEOS with the image referenced to ceos:4.25.4M
    # you can see we have 2 instances of this node defined here
    ceos1:
      kind: ceos
      image: ceos:4.25.4M
    ceos2:
      kind: ceos
      image: ceos:4.25.4M
    # This is how we are declaring our client nodes, basically we are telling containerlab to go to
    # hub.docker.com and download the centos:8 image and then create it locally (we also have 2 instances of this one)
    centos1:
      kind: linux
      image: centos:8
    centos2:
      kind: linux
      image: centos:8

  # links is right under topology, and it's what will allow us to connect our containers to each other
  links:
    - endpoints: ["ceos1:eth1","ceos2:eth1"]
    - endpoints: ["ceos1:eth2","centos1:eth1"]
    - endpoints: ["ceos2:eth2","centos2:eth1"]
